# FYS-MEK1110
Mechanics at University of Oslo, spring 2022.

## Molecular dynamics project
In addition to writing the first five mandatory assignments, I also did the project. The main implementation can be found in `n_atom_sim.py`. I advise you to ask your supervisor for help, rather than looking at my solution. Comparing results is better than comparing implementation.
